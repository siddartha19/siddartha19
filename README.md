I’m a startup generalist who loves taking ideas from 0 to 1 quickly. I work across product, engineering, and sales, which lets me ship quickly, validate with customers, and iterate until the solution truly clicks.

I’m currently a founding engineer at a YC startup, where I joined as the third employee and helped scale it from 0 to $70M. Previously, I was the first engineer at another YC-backed startup that grew from zero to $ 40 million. In both companies, I’ve worn every hat during my experience, building core features, defining product requirements, talking to customers, and helping drive growth.

What excites me most is building things that have a huge impact: understanding the problem, shaping the product, shipping quickly, and watching users love what I’ve built. I thrive in early-stage chaos and move fast to turn ambiguous ideas into real, working software.

Outside my startup roles, I’ve built and shipped multiple independent products:
InvestorMate (investormate.io), HealthAI (POC acquired), AIDA (AI Data Analyst), and CropOnSale (a POC we provided free of cost to the Government of Andhra Pradesh). These experiences sharpened my bias for action, my ability to validate fast, and my passion for turning big, ambiguous problems into real, working solutions.

I’m also passionate about mentoring and giving back to the community, helping others grow in their own journeys.
